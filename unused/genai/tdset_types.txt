Write a type definition in go for a custom resource definition called TDSet with the following elements:

struct Container:
 -  string "Image"
  - int "Port"

struct Service:
  -  int "Port"

struct Scheduling:
 - int "StartTime" with minimum 0 and maximum 23
 - int "EndTime" with minimum 0 and maximum 23
 - int "Replica" with minimum 0

Place the generate code in package "v1". Provide the result as golang file. Place remarks
and hints as comments into the code. Add kubebuilder comments for minimum and maximum validation directly before the elements inside the struct definition.
