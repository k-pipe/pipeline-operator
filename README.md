# pipeline-operator (branch helm)

This branch contains the definition of the helm chart for the pipeline operator.

The file [Chart.yaml]() is automically updated using the [current version](). The custom resource definitions are 
automatically pushed from the build process of the main branch. Files under [templates]() contain the additional 
chart files which are created manually.
